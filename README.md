# Project Title: Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis

## Brief Description
Unlocking Key Insights from KM Stores' 2009-2012 inventory data for the Abuja Division. This SQL-driven business intelligence analysis addresses sales, customer behaviour, and operational questions to make  strategic decisions.

## Project's Goal
To apply SQL skills as a Business Intelligence Analyst to analyze the inventory order data from Kultra Mega Stores (2009-2012). The primary objective is to extract key insights and findings to support the Business Manager in making informed strategic decisions, ultimately aiming to increase revenue and optimize operations.

## Business Questions
### Case Scenario I
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

### Case Sceanrio II
6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales?
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 ‚Äì 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer

## Data Used

### Analysis Performed
The analysis will involve applying SQL queries to address specific questions across the two case scenarios. This includes:
1. Identifying top-performing product categories and regions by sales.
2. Calculating specific sales figures (e.g., appliances in Ontario).
3. Analyzing customer segments to identify most valuable and bottom-performing customers, and understanding their purchasing patterns.
4. Evaluating shipping cost efficiency against order priority to advise on logistics.
5. Identifying customers who returned items.
The analysis aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to Kultra Mega Stores' management.
